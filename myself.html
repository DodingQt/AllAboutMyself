                    I’m Vince Carter Yamba, and I’m studying at SMCC Nasipit here in the Philippines. Growing up, I’ve always been someone who enjoys the simpler things in life, and cycling became one of my favorite ways to escape the noise. It’s not about racing or competing for me—just the freedom of riding and the peace it brings.

                    When I started college, I made sure cycling stayed a part of my routine. There’s something special about getting up early, hopping on my bike, and riding through the quiet streets before the day gets busy. It’s my time to think, clear my head, and get some fresh air. Whether it’s a short loop around town or a longer ride exploring new routes, cycling is my way to unwind.

                    I’m not the most extraordinary student, but cycling has kept me balanced through all the stresses of college life. It’s helped me meet some great people too—other students who share the same love for bikes. We go on weekend rides together, exchanging stories and tips along the way.

                    I’m not looking for anything too crazy with cycling, but it’s something that’s become a huge part of who I am. It’s my way of staying grounded, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon.
